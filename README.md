# Advent Of Code 2025

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. 
People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

Each folder is a day with part 1 and part 2 files seperated within it. This year I am using Python instead of C++. 

At a later date, since this year is shorter, I may revisit the days using C++ as well and include seperate folders for each language.
